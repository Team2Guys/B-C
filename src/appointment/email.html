    <p>Thank you for sending us your appointment enquiry. We will get back to you within a few hours to confirm your time slot.</br>
    Once it’s locked in, you can expect our professional team to arrive as close to the allotted time as possible. They'll bring as many samples as they can carry, allowing you a huge selection to choose from. You can browse comfortably at your leisure whilst they measure up.</br>
    Once fabric is selected they will provide you a quotation on the spot and if you wish to proceed, we can expect the deposit by cash, credit card or bank transfer (we can send an online link as well if required).</br>
    If you decide that you need more time to think about it, no problem at all, we dont do the pushy sales techniques and we will forward the quotation to you by the next working day at the latest.</p>
